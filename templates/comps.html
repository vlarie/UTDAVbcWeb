        <!-- The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

        Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
        Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
        Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
        Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section 
        (notice the background color change). -->

        <!-- A "Comparisons" page that:
        Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
        Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
        The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens. -->
