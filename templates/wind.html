    <div navbar>
        <!-- The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

        Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
        Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
        Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
        Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section 
        (notice the background color change). -->
